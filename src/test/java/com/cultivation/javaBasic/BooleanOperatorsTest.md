### should_perform_logical_boolean_operations()
1.What is the knowledge point of the test? Where is the official document to the knowledge point?
* The knowledge point of the tests is the logic that exists for boolean operators.

2.Why the test failed at first?
* Because of the lack of result for boolean operators.

3. Why you corrected the test that way?
* I corrected the tests that way because it is the expected logic for boolean operators.

4. Do you have further questions on this knowledge point?
* No questions so far.
